==Abstract==
Burstcoin File System ("BFS") is a file system optimized for Burstcoin. It features a light-weight table of contents ("TOC") for minimal overhead, a smart data fragmentation ("SDF") ensuring that reading a scoop in a mining round is just a single seek and a big sequential read, sector alignment and 4KiB addressing for optimal performance on current hard drives as well as a bad sector handling mechanism. BFS is operating system independent and can be embedded as a partition in any GPT formatted media. 

==Motivation==
Current file systems are not designed for Burstcoin and have several disadvantages when storing plotfiles, in particular:
file system overhead (mostly unused space that could be used to store nonces), fragmentation (when adding / deleting plot files of different sizes), operating system dependency and inefficient sector alignment (512e vs. native 4k sector alignment).

==Specification==

===Compatibility===
This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread consensus.
