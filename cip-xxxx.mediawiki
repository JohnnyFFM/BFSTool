==Abstract==
BFS is a file system optimized for Burst. It features a light-weight table of contents (“TOC”) for minimal overhead, 
a smart data fragmentation (“SDF”) ensuring that reading a scoop in a mining round is just a single seek and a big sequential read,
sector alignment and 4KiB addressing for optimal performance on current hard drives and a bad sector handling mechanism. 
BFS is operating system independent and can be embedded as a partition in any GPT formatted media. 

==Motivation==
Now with the current PoC used with Burstcoin, there indeed are time-memory tradeoffs possible.
This attack on PoC mining fairness was possible in theory, but not feasible economically, because the PoW required for
this mode of operation consumed far more energy than a PoC mining style.

However recent advancements in hardware and GPU performance do show, that economical feasibility is just a matter of time.

==Specification==

===Compatibility===
This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread consensus.
